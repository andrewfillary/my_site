		<h3>This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.</h2>
		<p>That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. Can we have Bender Burgers again? Yeah, lots of people did. And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? That's the ONLY thing about being a slave.</p>
		<ol>
		<li>Do a flip!</li><li>What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food.</li><li>In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms.</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Hello, little man. I will destroy you!</h3>
		<p>It's a T. It goes "tuh". All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school! You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go.</p>
		<p>Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.</p><p>You are the last hope of the universe.</p><p>And when we woke up, we had these bodies.</p>

		<h3>This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.</h1>
		<p>All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school! Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.</p>
		<p>I had more, but you go ahead. I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. <strong> Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes!</strong> <em> We have bigger problems.</em> We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera.</p>
